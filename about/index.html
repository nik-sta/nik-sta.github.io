I still remember the first try to upgrade my PC, which entertained me with a firework-like show after turning on the power switch. Fortunately, a friend and I got away with just a broken power fuse.</p><p>Currently, I’m leading local and international agile software engineering teams, which I built up from the ground at <a href=https://umb.ch/>UMB</a> to create time for our customers and us. My primary responsibility is to design and develop a cloud-native SaaS platform for process automation in a multi-tenant microservice architecture with Java/Kotlin, Spring Boot and Angular.</p><p>Previously, I developed high-available health-care systems for Swiss hospitals and later for family doctors. It was heavily based on relational data structures. During my vocational school time, I started paid side projects in Java and achieved to self-fund my Company: Viascom Ltd liab. Co., together with two colleagues. At Viascom we have crafted in cooperation with the sports faculty of the University of Heidelberg and a German corporation a software solution for gyms to take efficient care of their customers. Then I continued with manufacturing business apps on Android with Java. Consulted insurances, banks, and other financial service providers to implement reliable digital transformation projects with BPM.</p><p>Still, my emotional most significant success in the IT world was when I got nominated for one of the top three projects by <a href=https://www.ch-open.ch/>CH Open Source Awards</a>. When I arrived in Zurich, having in mind that I&rsquo;m from a much smaller city, the impression was overwhelming &mldr; The presentation in front of the audience back then was the start point of my today&rsquo;s strength and motivation. Since then, open-source has secured a special place in my heart.</p><p>Even when I leave the office, I tend to continue writing code at home. This is what keeps me up at night, a never-ending thirst to create beautiful, powerful things and share them with the world. Next to coding, I’m spending my leisure time with my wife, my dog Simba and a lot of travelling. In contrast, I’m trying not to miss any chances of doing something creative (<a href=https://stans.pictures/>stans.pictures</a>).</p><p><strong>I believe that software can improve the lives of people around the world.</strong></p></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
